# CROWDFUNDING STREAMLINED with VBA Scripting 
Data Analytics Bootcamp Module 1 Challenge: Excel_Challenge 

## SIGNIFICANCE
Efficiency reigns supreme in the ever-evolving landscape of crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo. With a growing array of participants and diverse campaign objectives, the need for streamlined processes has never been more apparent.

## SOLUTION/AIM
In November of 2023, I embarked on a project in collaboration with Columbia University to explore this dynamic terrain. My objective was to enhance operational efficiency in various domains by providing an enriched understanding of crowdfunding dynamics. 

## EXECUTION/PROJECT DESCRIPTION
In order to arrive at this understanding, I analyzed over a thousand campaign projects to uncover correlations between strategies and success metrics. Additionally, I tested the efficacy of my data collection and analysis methods by modernizing a rural town's vote-counting process using VBA scripting on Excel.

## FINDINGS
This dual approach not only helped me evaluate the effectiveness of my proposed optimized processes but also highlighted the broader significance of such optimizations. By bridging the gap between digital entrepreneurship and community governance, my project illuminates the crucial role of efficiency in achieving desired outcomes across various domains. Through this blend of theory and practice, this project is designed to drive innovation and progress, one insight at a time.
